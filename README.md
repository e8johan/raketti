Hybrid Raketti
==============

Copyright (C) 2016 Johan Thelin

Hybrid Raketti is an attempt to recreate the feeling of Turboraketti by Heikki
Kosola. I enjoyed many hours of flying it back in the '90s.

Usage
=====

This is a pure client side web application. If you want to run it locally, use something like Python's simple HTTP server, e.g. run the following in the project root:

There is not need to deploy this to your own web server, instead, use the URL e8johan.se/projects/raketti .
